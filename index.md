	<p>It's the one-year anniversary of my big day.</p>
	<p>On May 17, 2013, I suffered a stroke. A year later, painfully alive still, I request your presence in Brookline, Mass to celebrate...to celebrate...jeez, life, I suppose?</p>
<p>...To celebrate whatever, k? Either way, u wanna join us in Brookline on May 16, ~7pm, for a little party? U'll come over, we'll stand around chatting, maybe look at some grisly MRI and CT scans, talk about what might have been if little Kyujin hadn't gotten me out of that alley? You'll eat little carrot slices dipped in something you have to ask about? That kind of thing. Sound alright?</p>
